# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Udemy-Course-Work

## This is going to be where I will commit all of the work that I do through the course.

I came across a course on Udemy named 'The Complete Data Structures and Algorithms Course in Python'. I have decided to enroll in this course to enhance my understanding of algorithms and data structures in Python, which is my preferred language, and prepare myself for any job interviews that come my way during my job search.
